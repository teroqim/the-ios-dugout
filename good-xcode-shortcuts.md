XCode shortcuts worth knowing
=============================

First of all, install the fantastic app CheatSheet: http://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/
Then you can see all active shortcuts by holding down Cmd for a couple of seconds.

Here follows some shortcuts in XCode 6 I find invaluable.

Fuzzy find
----------
When in the editor and you need to fix something in, say, another view controller; do you move your mouse pointer over to the Navigator and click your way to the file you want to modify? It does the job, but what if I told you there is a far more effective way of doing the same thing without moving your hands from the keyboard? Meet the Fuzzy file search.
- __Cmd + Shift + O__ - Fuzzy search for files. Start using this and within a couple of weeks you'll be blazingly fast at finding your way through your code base and also you'll get very aware of how you're naming your files. In the dialog box that appears you don't need to type in the exact name of the file you're searching for. Here's the power of fuzzy search. Let's say you're want to switch over to a file called MyFantasticCustomViewController: pull up the fuzzy search then type in some characters from different parts of the name e.g. 'fancontrol' and watch the magic. As long as the letters you type are in the same order as they appear in the filename, no matter how many letters apart, the fuzzy search engine can find what you're looking for. Try it!
- __Enter__ and __Alt + Enter__ - When you've found your file you can eiter click on it to open, or you can press enter to open it in you editor, but in the case you have the Assistant editor open, use this shortcut to open the file in the assistant editor window.
