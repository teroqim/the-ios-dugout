My heap of iOS ideas

The iOS Dugout
==============
A place where all those lost iOS ideas come together. Swift, Objective-C, plain text, you name it.

This repo is intended as a place to 'throw in' solutions you don't want to lose by purging it from your project. At present there is no outspoken requirements for quality, but if it's shit, well, fix it. 
These solutions may or may not eventually make their way out of here as e.g. cocoa pods, blog posts or whatever.
When possible, please refer to posts/articles/etc that inspired you to write that solution, or from where you 'stole' the idea from.
These solutions are and should be open to anyone to use in their projects and modify to their satisfaction. Please, if a solution is not satisfactory, create an issue.

Typical cases when ideas end up here:
- Your designer decides your cool new animation is not going to be used in the app.
- Your designer decides that feature you worked on for a looooong time is no longer going to be featured in the app.
- You spend forever hunting down an answer to your specific problem and you just want to put it somewhere without to many expectations of documentation, and you may want to use it in another project.
- You build a class intended to be subclassed in project, but don't feel like building a cocoa pod for it just yet. 

NOTE: Use these solutions with caution. Make sure you fully understand anything you bring into your own repo.
