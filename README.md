The iOS Dugout
==============
A place for all those iOS development ideas on the verge of oblivion to gather.

This repo is intended as a place to 'throw in' solutions or ideas you just don't want to lose. At present there are no outspoken requirements for quality, but if it's shit, well, fix it.  
These solutions or ideas may or may not eventually make their way out of here as e.g. cocoa pods, blog posts or whatever.  
When possible, please refer to posts/articles/etc that inspired you to write that solution, or from where you 'borrowed' the idea.  
These solutions are and should be open to anyone to use in their projects and modify to their satisfaction. Please, if a solution is not satisfactory, create an issue.

Typical cases when ideas end up here:
- Your designer decides your cool new animation is not going to be used in the app.
- Your designer decides that the feature you were working on for a looooong time is no longer going to be featured in the app.
- You spend forever hunting down an answer to your specific problem instance. When you find the solution and add it to your current project, you get the feeling that you might want to use it in another project down the line, or maybe you want to write a blog post about it in the future, but in order to not digress from the task at hand you want to save it somewhere without spending a lot of time documenting it properly right away.
- You build a class intended to be subclassed in a project, but don't feel like building a cocoa pod for it just yet.
- You find a set of shortcuts in XCode that seem to fit together in an astounding way, and you want to write them down somewhere.

Just remember: Whatever It is, It is an enlightened version of what Was.

WARNING: Use these ideas with caution. Make sure you fully understand anything you bring into your own project.
